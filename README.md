# Supervised-Learning
### Credit risk poses a classification problem thatâ€™s inherently imbalanced. This is because healthy loans easily outnumber risky loans. In the following code, I will use various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. I will use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
### Using my knowledge of the imbalanced-learn library, I wiIl use a logistic regression model to compare two versions of the dataset. First, I will use the original dataset. Second, I will resample the data by using the RandomOverSampler module from the imbalanced-learn library.
### For both cases, I will get the count of the target classes, train a logistic regression classifier, calculate the balanced accuracy score, generate a confusion matrix, and generate a classification report.
